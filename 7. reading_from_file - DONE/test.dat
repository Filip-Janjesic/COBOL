// End of file: .gitignore
// This file is used to ignore certain files and directories in a Git repository.
// It specifies files that should not be tracked by Git, such as executables and specific data
// files that are not relevant to the version control.
// The file includes a comment indicating that it is a .gitignore file and lists the files and directories to ignore.
// The file is formatted with a simple list of patterns, one per line, that Git will ignore.
// The patterns include directories (like "Books/") and specific file types (like "*.exe").
// The last line is a comment indicating the end of recent edits, which is useful for tracking.
