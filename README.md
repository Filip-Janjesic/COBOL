# COBOL

This repository is my personal journey towards mastering the COBOL programming language. Each exercise is a separate step in learning the syntax, structure, and practical use of COBOL for file handling, arithmetic operations, and basic business logic. Every folder contains a `.cob` source file, a compiled `.exe`, and a corresponding `.md` file with notes and explanations.
